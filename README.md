# Translyze
Translyze: A powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing bank statements. Upload multiple statements and get detailed insights into your transactions.

Translyze is a bank statement analysis application designed to help users upload, combine, and analyze multiple bank statements. It provides features such as viewing transactions, summarizing expenses and income, generating detailed analysis reports, and managing transactions (e.g., editing or deleting them). The project is built in Python and leverages a combination of libraries and microservices for various functionalities.

# Translyze App Progress and Plans

## Current Status
The Translyzer app is currently functional as a command-line interface (CLI) tool. It allows users to upload and combine bank statements, view transactions, and generate analysis reports. The app uses microservices for specific tasks, which currently communicate via text files. The project is documented and in the process of being improved with additional features and a transition to more advanced architectural patterns.

## Future Plans
- Transition the codebase to object-oriented programming.
- Design and implement a user interface (UI) to replace the current CLI.
- Change microservices communication from text files to HTTP requests.
- Add a user login/signup feature.
